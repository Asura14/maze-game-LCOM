# Maze Game

##The concept

Within the course of Computer Laboratories, it was presented to me the development of a project where we should apply the knowledge obtained in classes in order to create an application, those being: Input/Output peripherals and their operation. Direct mapping in a process address space. Access to peripherals in polled mode and by interrupt; Processor interrupts in the IA-32 architecture and the interrupt controller, interrupt service routines in Assembly and in C.Study of some typical personal computer peripherals, such as keyboard, mouse, graphics card, real time clock, timer, loudspeaker and serial port; Programming in the C programming language: main differences with respect to C++ language; structured programming in C. Memory layout of a process; Function calls: mechanisms, parameter passing, storage of local variables and return values. Event based programming. Combined programming in C and the IA-32 processor family assembly; Creation and use of libraries. Static linking of object code; 
This game is a classic labyrinth in which the player/user controls a character and his aim is to reach a predefined target being that the game only ends when such occurs.

##Implementation
* PS/2 Mouse (Structs to define the mouse and it's coordinates)
* PC's timer/counter.
* PC's video card in text mode 
* The PC's Keyboard 
* PC's video card in graphics mode
